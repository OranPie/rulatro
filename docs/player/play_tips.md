## 1) Early Game (Ante 1-2)

- Prioritize consistency over high-roll combos.
- Keep enough money for at least one reroll option.
- Avoid overcommitting to narrow hand types too early.

## 2) Mid Game (Ante 3+)

- Build around your strongest repeatable trigger.
- Track boss effects before committing cards.
- Let consumables solve specific weak points (score, economy, hand quality).

## 3) Shop Decisions

- Good default order: economy -> scaling -> utility.
- Buy packs when your current build has clear upgrade targets.
- Do not spend all money every shop; reroll flexibility matters.

## 4) Better Playability

- Check score breakdown to learn what actually scaled.
- Watch event log when testing new strategies.
- Replay with fixed seed to compare two different routes.
